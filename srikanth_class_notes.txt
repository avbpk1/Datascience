features are also called dimensions
it is important to identify which features to keep and which features to drop because not all features are important

Categorical Plots
boxplot()

ax=sns.boxplot(x='day','y='tip',data=tips) -- just needs data and seaborn does the rest. Much simpler compared to matplotlib , extra paremeter -- showfliers=False wil remove outliers

--hue is saying it is going to draw -- for each x -- it will not draw 1 graph but it will draw 2 graphs . For e.g. hue="sex" it will draw a bar for each unique valie

--countplot() 
for each dawy -- how many transactions are there -- count plot gives that

Even for count plot, hue can be given 

whitegrid is an option that you can be provided
style = 'whitegrid' instead of dark

Difference between mmatplot lib and seaborn is -- in matplotlib, you have to set the data for grouping where as in seaborn -- it will do it , if we just specify the data and the x, y columns

-- Display data according to countries -- Total Area -- Average area
Once the data is in dataframe, it can be used to draw different stules

Categorical Plots
--Catplot
--these are fugure level
sns.catplot(,,,,col='smoker','') -- 2 different graphs for smoker and non smoker
in matplot -- you will have to define subplots and then do it

if we give col= 'day' it gives 4 graphs -- 1 for each day

The default estimator is mean -- which implies it gives the average biill value for each day 
subplots_adjust(top=0.75) -- will leave 25% margins overall at the top

-- you can also set rows 

--boxplot
catplot is a figure level 

kind parameter -- can be only 1 -- so, you cant have bar and line together for example

--stripplot
It is a scatter plot with 1 categorical value
stripplots can also use hue

--swarmplot -- swarmplot does not overlap-- it tries to mark each transaction clearly without overlapping
dodge is important only when you are using hue -- it clearly demarcates the lunch and dinner plots for examople

-- fligjts data -- timeseries data -- try various graphs
For timeseries data -- line graph is best. Other examples shareprice
senesexdata -- line graph
in seaborn -- u do not explicitly need to specify the grouping. estimator = sum -- will give the count of passengers on a given day.

-- linegraph is a relational map because it gives relation between x and y

figure plots are multiple plots

Matplot lib -- matplot lb is open source version eqqivalent to matlap
seaborn is a wrap on top of matplot lib and better.

matplotlib is a subset of seaborn

Anatomy of matplot lib

Figure is top most. A figure can have multiple AXES. Each Axes corresponds to a distribution. Plot, graph, axes all mean the same
1 Axes can have multiple Axis -- usually x and Y

--Assignment -- Try to explode the largest Wedge. Find out the largest wedge and pull it out.
-- matplotlibdemo -- piechart section -- 17
-- Every object is a collection of objects aain

ax = plt.pie(....)
t = plt.title (...)
print(ax) -- interesting output -- returns list of all objects -- example wedge objects. 

-- matplot lib -- scatter plots -- examples are there but seaborn is better. Much better for graph especially scatter plots
#plt.gcf().set_size_inches -- gcf is get current figure

Boxplot -- is of distribution for data

histogram -- distribution of data -- specify bins 
-- Range is kind of an iterator -- u dont get any thing until you take a value from otu

--Object API -- so far we have used module API. Plt is a module API. Object API gives more control
ax= plt.subplot()
print(type(ax))
ax.bar(dat_total) etc

Why do we need object level api

to create multiple graphs with the same data

fig.ax = plt.subplots(1,2) -- -- array of graphs

you can save the multi graphs as jpg and attach it as an attachment to email. -- 45.png -- look at a practical implementation of Python usage for lambda.

--47.png for Text -- zip(days,totals) --Printing text on graphs.

-- Countries json

Dynamo DB stores data in items -- each item is a json object.
json is forefront. xml was very popular and it was overtaken by json.  -- 48.png
-- countries = pd.read_json()
-- stacked grapjs

use data other than tips

-- End 05 Jun

-- Start 04 Jun
pandas -- page 35. Grouping an dother aggregate functions
-- most of the functions applicable to data frames are also applicable to series.
--df.fillna() -- fills null values

whole fillna is about imputation -- i.e. a technique used to filling the null values with an appropriate value like -- mean, median or 0
other techniques are forward fill and backward fill. Forward fill will take the previous non null value and put it. Backward fill will take the non null value and fills the previous null value with that.

-- Binning is the technique of dividing data into groups and helps in removing outliers for e.g.
-- Histogram is internally binning the data first and then it is drawing the plot
(85.0, 100.0] representation in maths indicates 85 -- parenteheses is included , ] square bracket --non inclusive i.e. 100 is not included

qcut -- is going dividde the data based on the percentile -- quantile based discretisation function

Categorical FEatures are to be Encoded -- 1 technique is to replace it with numbers.
But the problem with the number replacement is -- for e.g. if Male is encoded with 0 and F is 1. During calculations F will be treated as higher when compared to other.
In such cases, we create dummy columns
------Dummies
getdummies will retrieve all non-numberic columns   -- 42.png 
also called as 1 or/heart encoding
Equivalent to junk dimension probablu?

1 heart encoding will increase the number of columns.

-- Writing Data frame -- to json, to file 
orient is important for the json structure
each row should be saved as a json object
if we orient with records

Pandas
at() 
iat() dont support slicing and hence faster than loc and iloc
stick to loc if u r dealing with rows and columns. It is easier and intutive. 
df.loc[:8,:'subject'] # Rows upto row-level 8, cols upto subject
iloc -- is based on indexes rather than labels

df.filter(regex = 'e$') # select columns where column name ends with Letter e
df.filter(regex='[0-9]+$') # select columns ending with a numeric
df.filter(egex='6',axis=0) -- filter is all about labels and not data. This filters rows with row index 6

vecotrization is a term used to indicate that an operation is applied across the whole of the array
df.nlargest(4,'marks') # keep=first -- indicates even if there are duplicate values , only first one will be fetched
apply() and applymap() -- 022.png, 23.png

df.apply(lambda s: s.notnull().sum().axis =1) -- apply operation on rows -- default is 0 which means columns

In applymap -- every alue of the data frame is passed. 
df.applymap(lambda v:str(v).upper()) # will convert every element into upper.

df.name.upper() gives a value because upper() cannot be applied on series
--solution is -- df.name.str.upper() -- each value in the name series is converted to string and then subsequently apply any string related operation. Very powerful
--Masking is the term used to use 2 boolean conditions together. e.g. where a > 10 and a <15
--> Attribute str
df.name is a series and it is a collection of values. If we have to take each value in the series should be converted to uppercase. Perform an operation on each value. If we dont want to use apply.

----Broadcasting 
is the concept -- when 2 arrays are not of the same size. To bring them to the same size, numpy uses broadcasting 

simple example is scalar broadcasting. 
for e,g 
[1 2 3] + 10
[1 2 3] + [10 10 10]
[11 12 13]
Same logic for 2 dimensional as well -- slide 70 -- broadcast 2 example

axis = 0 will retrieve data column wise
axis = 1 will retrieve data row wise i.e. student wise

argmax() will give the index/position of the element that has the max value
argmin() will give the index/position fo the element that has min value
argsort() wil give indexes of the sorting order. Not the actual values

sa = a[a.argsort()]

screen shot 56
a and b are 2 different objects which have different ids but they point to the same memory. When you slice -- u get a view.

if we wamt to get a copy and not a view
a2 = a.copy() -- will give a copy of that into a2. Each one will have its own memory location.

arrays extracted based on a boolean index and array of indexes is a copy and not a view. Unlike slicing.

Boolean Indexing
Boolean index and the array index should have the same number of elements
Very powerful concept

When ever boolean indexing is applied on an array -- the resultant is a vector not a corresponding array of same size. Reason is that the number of elements 
In each row , the number of elements being selected and returned couuld vary depending on the condition
as we dont have the same number of elements in each row -- hence returns a single dimension array -- vector

numpy_demo.ipynb -- class room note book

Masking 

(a > 20) & (a < 40) -- 2 boolean indexes  -- remember to use & which is the mask. In python  # a [(a > 2 and a < 8 )] -- #Anding in python does not work here

a[prime(a)] -- prime(a) is a function which is generating a list of booleans. 

Boolean indexing is a feature of numpy and panda libraries. It is not available in regular programming languages

a.mean() is a method because any thing you call with an object is a method -- a method is always called with an object

np.add(x,y) -- function. Functions are universal and are called with the package  -- important differentiation

a1 = np.arange(5)
a2 = np,arange(5)
a1 == a2 # This will compare each element of the array a1 with the corresponding element in the array a2. And returns an array of booleans
a1.__eq__(a2) -- internal represemntation of a1 == a2. 

all() or any() methods -- if all elements are True , then all wil return True. else False

(a1==a2).all() -- Every element in the first array

Linear Regression
Slope is very important. 
Price = intercept + slope * size 
y=a+bX
y indicates dependent variable. x is independent variable.
Intercept is Y value when x = 0 
Example -- cab charges -- initial intercept(base price) + km * price per km

If there are more than 1 variable -- for e.g. Size, bedrooms , age

5000 per sq/ft
-100,000 for age
200,000 for additional bedroom

There is only intercept but multiple slopes
y = a + (b1 * x1) + (b2 * x2) + (b3 * x3)
Example
price = 0 + (100 * 5000) + (5  * -100000) + (3 * 200,000)

Error -- distance between the prediction and actual is called error or Residual
The goal is to adjust the slope in such a way that it is close to reality

Pandas -- Series and Datframes
Series is a function
Index in Series is also known as rowlabel
Index can be nonnumeric and non-unique

Elements in a series can be accessed by position also. For e,g - s[0]
Error will be returned in case the custom index is also numeric and the position given is not defined as part of the custom numeric index. To overcome use the properties loc and iloc
loc is purely based on custom index. iloc is based on position index		


In dictionary -- key is unique
In series -- index can be duplicated

Display values in a series where there is a decrease from a previous value.

ndarray means numpy array
-- End 21st April

--apply
marks.apply(get_grade)
equivalent function in python is map 
map(get_grade, arks) but you need to write a for loop for printing
for v in map(get_grade,marks):
print(v) 

Slicing is important topic

You cant use loc for sorting and displaying top 2.
Because the index keeps changing. loc is position based on position and hence will display in correct values
for e.g. narks.sort_values(ascending=False).loc[:3] will all values until position 3 which is all values
For index based retrieval -- use loc
For position based retrieval -- use iloc

Fill nulls with values is called Imputing the values

When ever we use [] or loc[] it uses index
iloc[] will use position

Train , Validation and Test data sets in the range of 60%, 20%, 20%

Cross validation will divide the data into K-Fold . If k =4 it will split into 4 sets. For each data set, a model is created.
The advantage is -- every observation is used in training and every observation is used in testing

model = 
scores = cross_val_score(model, train, y, cv = 5)

some of the algorithms use cross validation

E.g. LogisticRegressionCV
train_test_split?

confusion matrix gives an array of true positives and true negatives
